# Spooky Stories
Created by Avinash VK and Srujan Deshpande
## Inspiration
We wanted to create a fun game to play with a Halloween theme!
## What it does
Spooky Stories allows you to create your own spooky stories using a Pass the Story style format. Everyone on the Discord server has a chance to put their own additions into the story!  

If you want to read a story, you can read a random story written by someone else or even re-read your past ones.
## How we built it
1. Node.js with discord.js
2. Cockroach DB
3. Google Cloud Platform

## Challenges we ran into
- Working with Cloud Run, Build and App Engine
- Deploying and starting with Cockroach DB

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It works!

## What we learned
Cockroach DB is pretty cool and CI/CD using GCP is very useful!

## What's next for Spooky Stories
Add more stories, reddit integration, maybe even voice access?
